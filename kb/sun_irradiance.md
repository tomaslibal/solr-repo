The radian energy that is dissipated by the Sun and is received by the planet Earth is called the Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) [1]. The solar constant equals 1 unit of total solar irradiance which is roughly 1360 W/m^2 [2]. Some of this energy is absorbed by the planet's atmospehere. 

Visible light is irradiance in the wavelength between 380nm and 750nm and represents about 50% of TSI [3].
