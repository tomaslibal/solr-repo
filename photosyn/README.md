Artificial leaf is the idea of producing "solar fuel" from the Sun energy using
a similar (or in principle, the same) process as the photosynthesis.

Daniel Nocera is a Hardvard professor working on this idea, as well as Nate Lewis
at Caltech.

The basic idea is to use electricity generated inside the "leaf" to split water
into hydrogen and oxygen and store these in cells as fuel. When energy is
demanded, a fuel-cell can generate the electricity and the water is the waste
product of the reversed process.
